# Python-Assett
This assett include techniques implementation and design pattern 
1. Builtin - implementation
This one include my implementation and learned stuff in Python built-in classes and libraries.
It includes collections, set, dictionary advance, and class builtin likes __gt__, bytes, repr, __add__, etc

2. Design Patterns
For such a strong OOP programmnig language, this one is highly recommended as one of my assett.
I'm gonna implement singleton, factory, proxy, adapter, strategy, MVC, and etc

3. Scheduling - Implementation
As the aspect of parallelism programming, or I dont know if threading is considered as a concurrency type 
according to Microsoft, but this is a multicore PC, so I guess that wont be the case.
I gonna implement schedule algorithm in this directory.
